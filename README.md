# first-repository
repository for my physics simulations <br>
the notebooks all use qutip 4  https://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html <br>
the notebook titled '3-level lambda system' has simple steady state solutions to 3 - level lambda system. <br> The notebook titled 'transient 3 level system solutions' has time dependent hamiltonians simulating a ramp of the detuning.<br>
the pdfs of the mathematical framework are attached - it's best to read the pdf for 3 level system first and then go to the 13level file.
